# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains system architecture documentation, design decisions, and technical diagrams for the educational AI applications developed during the internship.

## Directory Structure

- `diagrams/`: Technical diagrams showing system components and interactions
- `decisions/`: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key technical choices

## Diagram Guidelines

1. Use standard notation (UML, C4 model, etc.)
2. Include clear labels and descriptions
3. Document both high-level and component-level architectures
4. Note key integration points with AI services

## Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Template

```markdown
# ADR [NUMBER]: [TITLE]

## Status
[Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded]

## Context
Brief description of the technical context and problem being solved.

## Decision
Clear statement of the architectural decision made.

## Consequences
- Positive outcomes
- Potential challenges
- Implementation considerations
- Security implications

## Alternatives Considered
Other options that were evaluated and why they weren't chosen.

## References
Links to relevant documentation, patterns, or resources.
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep diagrams up to date with implementation changes
2. Document both successful and unsuccessful architectural decisions
3. Include rationale for AI-specific architectural choices
4. Reference relevant weekly updates where appropriate
5. Maintain clear separation between public and private implementation details
