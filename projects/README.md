# Projects & Demonstrations

This directory contains code snippets and demo projects that showcase the technical concepts and implementations from the internship.

## Directory Structure

- `snippets/`: Focused code examples demonstrating specific technical concepts
- `demos/`: Small, self-contained projects showing integrated functionality

## Code Snippet Guidelines

When adding code snippets:

1. Remove any sensitive or proprietary information
2. Include clear comments explaining the concept
3. Focus on architectural patterns and AI integration approaches
4. Document dependencies and requirements
5. Add context about how it fits into the larger system

Example snippet structure:
```markdown
# [Concept Name]

## Purpose
Brief explanation of what this code demonstrates

## Technical Context
- Where this would be used
- Key dependencies
- Important considerations

## Code Example
```[language]
// Sanitized code showing the concept
```

## Key Points
- Important technical details
- Best practices demonstrated
- Potential variations
```

## Demo Project Guidelines

For demo projects:

1. Keep projects focused and minimal
2. Include clear setup instructions
3. Document AI service requirements
4. Explain educational technology relevance
5. Note any security considerations

## Best Practices

1. Maintain clear documentation
2. Update examples as architecture evolves
3. Link to relevant ADRs and weekly updates
4. Include error handling and edge cases
5. Document AI model considerations
